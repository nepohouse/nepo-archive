<p>This is an image of DK Pan's project <i>Time is Memory (Seattle Sky)</i>. Due to adverse weather conditions the skywriting happened on Sunday August 30th 2015 - the day after NEPO 5k. If you were lucky to look up you would have seen the letters appearing in the sky, one by one, and then dissipating, fading away.</p>

<p>NEPO 5K Don't Run happened just like that: conjured up it appeared as if from the thin air in 2011. Today, after five years of  building and creating NEPO 5K Don't Run is but a faint memory. It was a fun exhilarating ride (as - I imagine- was the pilot's flight that day). It took us for a spin and offered a whole new perspective. I'll be sorting through those memories for a long time. </p>

<p>Here are some photos to remind us  <a href="nepo5k2015.html">of all the great things that just happened</a>.</p>


____________________________________________________________


<p><img src="NEPO5k2015/the_end_is.jpg" width="500"><br>

<p>I don't even know where to start so I will start at the end. And what an end it was! I feel like we went through all the seasons (Seattle seasons anyway) and related weather phenomena all in one day. Fittingly my emotional states followed a similar pattern finally settling down on happy and extremely grateful.</p>

<p>Thank you to all the participating artists for all your brilliant creativity and hard work. I'm sure this year has proven difficult for many of you and tested the limits of what it means for you and your art to exist outside, unprotected and exposed to the elements. For us, seeing your flexibility and resolve to make it work (against all atmospheric odds) meant a world. It is what propelled us forward through the mayhem of last week's preparations.</p>


<p>Thank you! Although this project is ending we hope to work with you in the years to come and find new ways to collaborate.</p>

<p>Thank you to all the volunteers who helped to make this possible, without you we would be blowing in the wind!</p>

<p>The End is ... Long live NEPO!</p>

<p><img src="NEPO5k2015/nepo_team.jpg" width="500"><br>

<p>I also want to acknowledge and give thanks to my amazing collaborators Sierra Stinson, Zack Bent and Serrah Russell. I think it is rare to find people with whom you are able to co-create a monster project like this one, on a shoestring, for five years in a row and still love them and be best friends. I feel lucky to have them in my life.</p>

<p>As you may imagine it's a very exciting - and very stressful - time here at NEPO control center. There are some details to be ironed out, red tape removed and few burning hoops jumped through, but all in all it's coming together nicely, not in the least thanks to my stellar co-curators Sierra Stinson and Zack Bent.</p>

<p>Did I mentioned that the route will be reversed? For the semblance of consistency we have to do something backwards - for those of you who still didn't figure this out: NEPO is OPEN BACKWARDS. So there, the route goes backwards this year. That also means that it goes downhill (and it's shortened). However you look at it it's a win-win situation. NEPO is back - <b> expect the unexpected!</b>

<p>There are around 70 talented <b>artists</b> participating this year: Vis-a-Vis Society, Britta Johnson, Gretchen Bennett, Nathaniel Russell, Paul Komada, Lindsey Apodaca, MKNZ, Ruth Marie Tomlinson, Taylor Pinton, Matthew Hilger, Whitney Ford-Terry, Rumi Koshino, Joanna Lepore, Erin Elyse Burns, Graham Downing, Max Kraushaar, Virginia Wilcox, Hanita Schwartz, Meital Katz-Minerbo, Glenn Herlihy, Leanne Grimes, Brandon Aleson, Ken Turner, Serrah Russell, Sarah Galvin, Maggie Carson Romano, Eric John Olson, Anne Blackburn, Lauren Max, C.M. Ruiz, Nicholas Nyland, Nat Evans, Aaron Asis, Anna Koosmann, Stephen Sewell, Julia Haack, Ye-Ye Collective, Fictilis, Kate Clark, George Rodriguez, John Osebold, Chris Buening, Seth Damm, Keeara Rhoades, A K Mimi Alin, Allyce Wood, Andrew Peterson and meadow starts with p, Andy Fallat, Diana Falchuk, JD Banke, Eric E. Aguilar, NKO, Devon Midori Hale, Keely Isaak Meehan and Manifold Motion, Bryan Schoneman, Zack Bent, Jennifer Zwick, Rodrigo Valenzuela, Amanda Manitach, Alice Ghosti, Baso Fibonacci, Seanjohn Walsh and more.</p>

<p>I can't wait for all these fun, exciting and thoughtful projects come to life!</p>

<p><b>Finish-line show</b> MCed by Jake Stratton will feature live music by Bavarian Village Band, multimedia show by Airport, DJ Never Leaves, performance by Seattle Butoh Festival, DAIPANbutoh dancers, storefront video installations, LxWxH pop-up store, food trucks and beer garden (cross your fingers, we are still working out the logistics).</p>

<p><b>Date:</b> Saturday September 8, 2012</p>

<p><b>Time:</b> <br>
Registration by Vis-a-Vis Society at NEPO House 2:30-4:00pm<br> 
Don't Run  4:00-7:00pm<br>
Finish-line show 6:00-10:00pm</p>

<p><b>Where:</b><br>
Start at NEPO House on Beacon Hill (1723 S Lander Street, Seattle, WA 98144)<br>
Finish in front of Kobe Terrace Park in the International District (S Main Street and Maynard Avenue S)</p>

<h3>Sorting through the NEPO 5k documentation</h3>

<p>It took me >FOREVER< to sort through the hundreds of photos, but here it is: the encapsulation of the moment is almost complete as you can see on these pages. Speaking of forever: I feel like the old man Cronos most definitely had his fingers in this project. <b>It was a walk through time as much as it was a walk through space.</b> A chronological journey of experiences that were meant to build upon each other. In your imagination you can follow the journey here and if you pay attention you will see the light (and shadows) change throughout the day...</p>

<h3>NEPO House show reframed</h3>

<p>Hello NEPO artists!</p>  

<p>While we were already changing everything (willingly or not) we thought what the heck and also reframed the concept for the NEPO House show. We have abandoned the idea of an auction (which felt a  little tight and stifling to wild experimentation which we hope will take place). So instead of thinking of  and interpreting "action" (our key concept for this event) as a merely physical, kinetic activity, we want to take a broader view  and include a plethora of activities that artists engage in. We want to take a look at action as a social performance.</p>

<p>This is where you come in.  The theme of the show at this NEPO House will be the deconstructed world of the artist.  It should be a blast, and there are a lot of ways to participate.  Here's the overview of what's going on.</p>

<h5>The NEPO Rooms:</h5>

<p>The Curator's Room:  an archive of images provided by participating artists will be available in the curator's room for spontaneous and continual re-arrangement, providing a platform for perpetual re-contextualization and development of new narratives.</p>

<p>The Critics' Room:  Seattle's art critics will be live-tweeting the event and the tweets will be physically printed (to press!) as soon as they're posted online.  These print-outs will be posted on a wall in the critics' room for discussion, perusal, and further deconstruction. (Runs from 6 pm - 8 pm)</p>

<p>The Dealers' Room:  four prominent Seattle dealers and gallerists will be seated around a round table conversing amongst themselves.  (Runs from 6 pm - 8 pm)</p>

<p>The Soapbox:  a literal soapbox in the upstairs bathroom will provide the ultimate platform for self-promotion, tirades, interviews, or performance (sky's the limit!).  A live feed camera will be recording whatever happens on the soapbox and sending it to a video monitor downstairs.  (Runs from 6 pm - 8 pm)</p>

<p>The Gallery:  a room dedicated to the traditional presentation of works for quiet contemplation and viewing.</p>

<p>Social Room:  for this NEPO House the kitchen is an area reserved exclusively for drinking (no art involved here whatsoever), emphasizing the strictly social (and free-booze-and-food) aspect of art openings. Facebook and Facetime activities encouraged.</p> 

<p>Big Loud Art Room: - (living room) available to house a large (larger) sculpture, interactive piece or installation, performance.</p>

<p>Plus the "Institutions" of higher art and learning represented in some shape or form on our spiral(ing) staircase.</p> 

<img src="NEPO5/NEPO_badge_white_72.jpg">

<h3> 5K preparation hits a running start (but in the end, ends up walking)</h3> 


<p>As might be expected, organizing the NEPO event of the year - more expansive and far-reaching than ever before - has been a complex process and kept us on our toes.  In the past two months the projected goal of <b>NEPO 5K Show and Run</b> has taken a U-turn and evolved a bit.</p>

<p>Instead of a 5K run, the September 10th event will be a <b>NEPO 5K DON'T RUN</b> (the City of Seattle was ultimately unable to give us a permit to run in the streets, so we renamed our event accordingly).  The new scheduled route of events will begin in Pioneer Square at Occidental Park and will integrate a number of performance art events as well as the participation of area galleries.  Along the route to NEPO House, guests will find neighborhoods turned inside out (a city wide OPEN house) and will encounter a variety of happenings, interventions, and performances performed by local artists.  This NEPO 5K DON'T RUN (hop, skip, crawl, jaunt, hobble, trek, stumble, trot, moonwalk, walkabout, nur, unrun and norun) is scheduled for 4pm - 6pm.  The route concludes at NEPO House, which will be hosting its (un)usual blend of art, performance, and inversions from 6pm - 9pm.  Mark your calendars accordingly!</p>

<h3>NEPO House & Shunpike</h3>
<p>After a few meetings with some of the staff at Shunpike, as of March 2011 NEPO House is pleased to announce the beginning of a partnership with Shunpike as one of its Associated Programs.   Committed to helping small and mid-size organizations like NEPO House manage financial and administrative tasks, Shunpike is a much-appreciated service staffed by a great group of individuals.  We're happy to be on board.  Thank you, Shunpike!</p>

<h3>NEPO House forms a board of directors</h3>
<p>In November 2009 NEPO House <a href="http://www.nepohouse.org/nepo1.html" target="new">opened its doors</a> to the public for the first time, conceived nurtured, sustained, and organized solely by founder Klara Glosova.  After a year of operation and many openings later, NEPO is all grown up - at least enough to require some additional help.  
A group of six artists, writers, and organizers from across Seattle - many of whom have participated in various NEPO events since its conception - have joined together with Klara to form NEPO's inaugural board of directors.  Current members include Bond Huberman, Amanda Manitach, Todd Jannausch, Rumi Koshino, Erin Shafkind, and Susanna Bluhm Callahan.  </p>

<p><a href="nepo3.html">So here is prety much a full scoop.</a><br>

<p><strong>Update on Painting NEPO letters:</strong></p>
<p>After receiving some house painting advice from a professional, I decided to paint the letters on another sunny day (TBD) with some help from neighborhood folks. Hopefully it will be done before the party.</p>

<p>So, <strong> NO need to bring ladders and brushes to the party</strong> - Thank you!</p>

___________________________________________________________


<h2>May 3, 2010:  more info about NEPO 3: Air, Water, Fire <br>
(we will leave the Earth behind on this one)</h2>

<img src="nepo_images/NEPO3_flipflop.jpg" width="500">


<p>About number 3:  it is shaping up as a lot of audio/visual work and projections inside and outside of the house. Included will be work about waves, clouds, stars, garbage and the things we leave behind, sunsets, various weather phenomena, flying in dreams and more.</p>

<p>(As to why only three elements were included: it is our third show, so we decided to stick with three elements in order to not run ahead of ourselves. I will tell you a little later how it all turned out - or come to the show to see for yourself.)</p>

<p>NEPO 3 event will have two components: action and projection</p>

<p><strong>The action part</strong>:  you are invited to participate and help me paint big red N E P O letters on the side of the house. You are encouraged to bring a tall ladder (if you have one) and a paint brush (if you have one).  This will take place in the afternoon or early evening - if weather permits. I was hoping to get (and eat) a bunch of cherries since the inspiration behind this project comes from "FRESH CHERRIES" sign in Eastern Washington - but looking at the current weather trend I doubt they will be in season. We will see.</p>

<p><strong>Projections and performances</strong>:  will take place as soon as sun goes down (exactly at 9:01 pm) - stay tuned for performance and music schedule.</p>

<p>SAVE THE DATE: <strong>SATURDAY, JUNE 5, 2010</strong></p>

<p> Back here soon with more,<br>

<h3>brainstorming  and talks about collaboration w <a href="http://www.artscorps.org/">ARTS CORPS</a></h3>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I met with Lara Davis and Lauren Atkinson and we talked about cooperation on the home_page.project. I am very excited about this, I have worked with them at Kimball Elementary and they are my favorite arts organization connecting practicing artists across all disciplines with kids - they will go anywhere kids need more art (=many places). Lauren mentioned the upcoming show at the Frye: <a href="http://fryemuseum.org/exhibition/3315/">Tim Rollins and Kids of Survival (K.O.S.)</a> - as something to think about and get inspired by. Having a couple of my own I think it would be great to include kids in the home_project.experiment. </p

<h2>LIMITS and BOUNDARIES: an idea for a show?</h2>

<p>I want to curate a show about "Limits and Boundaries". It will explore artist's take on dealing with limitations, something many people are experiencing these days,  mainly on economic and material levels. But  those levels affect other realms and cause adjustment of  ideas and thoughts.  While the concept of limits might not be one of the most popular in the history of humankind (at least not in our western civilization where we think we would love to keep expanding  indefinitely), in my mind limits and boundaries are not necessarily a negative thing - they can be freeing and liberating as well as grounding. They bring people down to earth and make them work and create within real not just imaginary parameters and, I should add, sometimes produce real as opposed to imaginary works.</p> 

<p>I feel the theme is fitting, because our house is an example of creating  something within a very tight set of rules and limitations and discovering a unique solution. The limits were instrumental to the creation.</p>

<p>Then there is the other way to look at it: transgressing, dissolving, erasing, blending boundaries. Just because -  just because boundaries, limits exist (in real world or our imagination). Just because we are humans ...\\\???</p>

<p>What is your take on this? Email me if you would like to contribute your ideas, work or thought experiments.</p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h4>another idea for show: My Home Is My Castle (Looking for Home Inside and Out)</h4>

Where does our sense of security, safety and privacy come from? Is there a such a place as home. If yes, where is it? 
<br>also, home made, home baked ... more on this coming up later.

<h4>Interior Spaces</h4>

<p>Here are some pics of the interior spaces (notice I have cleaned up).

<h2> What, where and why about home_page.project</h2> 

<p>The main idea is to develop project space/gallery in my house on Beacon Hill, and to present a series of art shows and events relevant to our place and moment in time. I want to open the space in my home to both artists and audiences. My aim is to organize shows, readings and performances that comment on, contribute  to, and experiment with, the very moment we live in. I  hope to create new connections among local artists and community and to share our work and ideas with larger audiences. The very idea of having art shows/events in my home is about sharing, being local and open. </p>

<p>Why in my house? In my mind, blending of private and public realms, is reflective of living and working in the present moment (i.e. the ubiquitous Reality TV shows, You Tube, Blogs and general trends of decentralization). In the sea of virtual spaces and information, this project is about making a real, physical, YOU ARE HERE, dot on the map.  I think of it as creating real, physical, flesh-and-bones website that exists in body as well as in spirit. If a website is my home in the virtual world,  then I want my home to be a website in the real world. Just like a website I want my home to fully reflect what I do and who I am. I want to use this project as a platform for experimenting with curatorial ideas, create site specific installations and performances and bring the artwork out of established venues in to the neighborhood where I live.</p>

<a href="home_page.project.html"><img src="nepo_images/FRESH_ART.jpg"></a><br>
a cherry on top: on my recent road trip I got inspired by a huge FRESH CHERRIES sign in eastern Washington. The letters in the photo are just a mock-up, but I plan to make it real.
