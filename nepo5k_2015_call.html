<h3>NEPO 5K DON'T RUN 2015</h3>

<h2>Call for art projects</h2> 

<p><img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_002.jpg" width="600"></p>

<p>This year NEPO 5k Don't Run will take place on August 29th, 2015. The upcoming event will be particularly meaningful for us as it will be the fifth and final iteration of NEPO 5K Don't Run in this location. It it will mark an ending of an amazingly transformative five year cycle. We want it to be a culmination and a celebration of all the creativity and love poured over these city streets over the past five years. Please submit your proposal and help us make this <b>LAST HURRAY</b> memorable. </p>

<p>We are seeking work in a variety of forms, including site-specific installations, performances, sculpture, visual art, street art, participatory and interactive works. Each year artists create 50 - 60 site-specific projects along the 5 kilometer route leading from Hing Hay park in the International District to NEPO House on Beacon Hill.</p>

<p>The route is varied and an interesting mix of urban and suburban environment. The start, in the heart of the International District, gives way to a grittier underworld under the freeway overpass only to emerge on top of Jose Rizal Bridge with one of the most spectacular sweeping views of the city. The initial dramatic ascent is followed by a mid-way repose in the grassy Daejeon park centered by its pagoda. The last leg of the journey leads through the Beacon Hill neighborhood with its inconsistent block to block feel and a few coveted treasure spots such as the cave like garage overgrown with ivy. Finish line is in front of NEPO House. See the route map below.</p>


<p>NEPO 5K DON'T RUN 2015<br>
Date: Saturday <b>August 29th, 2015</b>, 12-10pm<br>

The artwork has to be installed and taken down on the same day (with some exceptions)</p>
