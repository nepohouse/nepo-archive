<h3>NEPO 5K DON'T RUN 2014</h3>

<h2>Call for art projects</h2> 

<p>We are seeking work in a variety of forms, including site-specific installations, performances, sculpture, visual art, street art, participatory and interactive works for the  FOURTH iteration of NEPO 5k Don't Run. If you are interested in co-creation of this unique NOT RUNNING art EXPERIENCE, please read below about how to apply.</p>

<p>About the event:<br>
Conceived of by a group of artists in 2011, <b>NEPO 5k Don't Run</b> is a one-of-the-kind art event that annually transforms mundane streets of Seattle into a temporary wonderland. Each year artists create 50 - 60 site-specific projects along the 5 kilometer route leading from Hing Hay park in the International District to NEPO House on Beacon Hill. Artists creatively utilize and highlight many features of Seattle's urban environment: they install and perform their works along the ordinary city streets, in garages, pagodas, in a grass meadow, along a bike path, below a bridge and under a freeway underpass. The range of projects spans many artistic disciplines.  Every aspect of this walk is a creative happening - a visual and symbolic experiment in creating a more enjoyable world through active participation.</p>

<p>NEPO 5k Don't Run 2014<br>
Date: Saturday <b>September 6th, 2014</b>, 12-8pm<br>
Start: Hing Hay park (International District)<br>

The artwork has to be installed and taken down on the same day (with some exceptions)</p>
