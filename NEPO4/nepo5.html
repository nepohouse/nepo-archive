<h2> WATCH OUT!</h2>

<p> FIRST EVER DON'T RUN COMING TO SEATTLE 9/10/11.</p>

<img src="NEPO5/NEPO_badge_72.jpg">

<br>
<p>The operation that brought you several
experimental artist happenings inside one,
very unordinary Beacon Hill home presents
an even bigger boundary-blurring,
community-involving, city-loving art event
that Seattle has not seen before.</p>

<p>Starting in Occidental Park, NEPO 5K
DON'T RUN transforms an ordinary 3-mile,
walk-able route through your city into an
unforgettable journey (really), integrating
site-specific performances, interventions
and installations along the way. Walkers
and not-runners will find neighborhoods,
homes, galleries, storefronts and
community venues turned inside out (a citywide
OPEN house).</p>

<p>The route concludes at NEPO House,
which will be hosting its (un)usual blend of
art, experimentation, performance, and
inversions - and of course a Beacon Hill
community celebration, with all the
neighbors invited.</p>

<p>If you're not an artist, or don't think you'll be
participating in the installation side of
things, please keep in mind:
Anyone is invited to participate, assemble a
non-racing team to engage in friendly
competition with other teams that aren't
running (this message is entirely open to
interpretation).</p>

<p> Interested in participating? Sign up <a href="contact.html"> here</a>.</p>

<h3>NEPO House show reframed</h3>

<p>Hello NEPO artists!</p>  

<p>While we were already changing everything (willingly or not) we thought what the heck and also reframed the concept for the NEPO House show. We have abandoned the idea of an auction (which felt a  little tight and stifling to wild experimentation which we hope will take place). So instead of thinking of  and interpreting "action" (our key concept for this event) as a merely physical, kinetic activity, we want to take a broader view  and include a plethora of activities that artists engage in. We want to take a look at action as a social performance.</p>

<p>This is where you come in.  The theme of the show at this NEPO House will be the deconstructed world of the artist.  It should be a blast, and there are a lot of ways to participate.  Here's the overview of what's going on.</p>

<h5>The NEPO Rooms:</h5>

<p>The Curator's Room:  an archive of images provided by participating artists will be available in the curator's room for spontaneous and continual re-arrangement, providing a platform for perpetual re-contextualization and development of new narratives.</p>

<p>The Critics' Room:  Seattle's art critics will be live-tweeting the event and the tweets will be physically printed (to press!) as soon as they're posted online.  These print-outs will be posted on a wall in the critics' room for discussion, perusal, and further deconstruction. (Runs from 6 pm - 8 pm)</p>

<p>The Dealers' Room:  four prominent Seattle dealers and gallerists will be seated around a round table conversing amongst themselves.  (Runs from 6 pm - 8 pm)</p>

<p>The Soapbox:  a literal soapbox in the upstairs bathroom will provide the ultimate platform for self-promotion, tirades, interviews, or performance (sky's the limit!).  A live feed camera will be recording whatever happens on the soapbox and sending it to a video monitor downstairs.  (Runs from 6 pm - 8 pm)</p>

<p>The Gallery:  a room dedicated to the traditional presentation of works for quiet contemplation and viewing.</p>

<p>Social Room:  for this NEPO House the kitchen is an area reserved exclusively for drinking (no art involved here whatsoever), emphasizing the strictly social (and free-booze-and-food) aspect of art openings. Facebook and Facetime activities encouraged.</p> 

<p>Big Loud Art Room: - (living room) available to house a large (larger) sculpture, interactive piece or installation, performance.</p>

<p>Plus the "Institutions" of higher art and learning represented in some shape or form on our spiral(ing) staircase.</p>
