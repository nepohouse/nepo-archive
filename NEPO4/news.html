<h3> 5K preparation hits a running start (but in the end, ends up walking)</h3> 


<p>As might be expected, organizing the NEPO event of the year - more expansive and far-reaching than ever before - has been a complex process and kept us on our toes.  In the past two months the projected goal of <b>NEPO 5K Show and Run</b> has taken a U-turn and evolved a bit.
<br><br>
Instead of a 5K run, the September 10th event will be a <b>NEPO 5K DON'T RUN</b> (the City of Seattle was ultimately unable to give us a permit to run in the streets, so we renamed our event accordingly).  The new scheduled route of events will begin in Pioneer Square at Occidental Park and will integrate a number of performance art events as well as the participation of area galleries.  Along the route to NEPO House, guests will find neighborhoods turned inside out (a city wide OPEN house) and will encounter a variety of happenings, interventions, and performances performed by local artists.  This NEPO 5K DON'T RUN (hop, skip, crawl, jaunt, hobble, trek, stumble, trot, moonwalk, walkabout, nur, unrun and norun) is scheduled for 4pm - 6pm.  The route concludes at NEPO House, which will be hosting its (un)usual blend of art, performance, and inversions from 6pm - 9pm.  Mark your calendars accordingly!</p>

<h3>NEPO House & Shunpike</h3>
<p>After a few meetings with some of the staff at Shunpike, as of March 2011 NEPO House is pleased to announce the beginning of a partnership with Shunpike as one of its Associated Programs.   Committed to helping small and mid-size organizations like NEPO House manage financial and administrative tasks, Shunpike is a much-appreciated service staffed by a great group of individuals.  We're happy to be on board.  Thank you, Shunpike!</p>

<h3>NEPO House forms a board of directors</h3>
<p>In November 2009 NEPO House <a href="http://www.nepohouse.org/nepo1.html" target="new">opened its doors</a> to the public for the first time, conceived nurtured, sustained, and organized solely by founder Klara Glosova.  After a year of operation and many openings later, NEPO is all grown up - at least enough to require some additional help.  
A group of six artists, writers, and organizers from across Seattle - many of whom have participated in various NEPO events since its conception - have joined together with Klara to form NEPO's inaugural board of directors.  Current members include Bond Huberman, Amanda Manitach, Todd Jannausch, Rumi Koshino, Erin Shafkind, and Susanna Bluhm Callahan.  </p>
