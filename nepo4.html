<h2>NEPO 4: Identities revealed</h2>

<img src="NEPO4/NEPO4_newZubrSoshka.jpg"><br>
<div class="credit4">Zubr, Soshka - by Klara Glosova</div>


<p>Dear visitors,<br>
Welcome to Natural Educational POrtal (NEPO). I am happy to announce that the state of affairs in our museum isn't nearly as bad as previously thought and imagined. Despite the current economic situation, we were able to open many new exhibits to public. We can only speculate, that the source of this good fortune can be attributed to a sudden, and so far unexplained, influx of karma bucks.</p> 

<p>Therefore I am extremely thankful to the generous volunteer employees of NEPO for sharing their talents and skills, and in general, for being and doing good. I'm happy to reveal the true identities of the participating artists and give credit where credit is due. So please, read on, see their work.</p>

<p>Offered in service, yours and truly,<br>

klara</p>

<p>p.s. Clicking on the real artist's name will take you to their web site</p>

<p><strong>What ever happened to Patience?</strong><br>
Observe this modern man's attempt at learning patience. In his world of technology, everything is fast-paced, based on instant gratification. His is a culture of immediacy, focused intently on the now.<br>
He is painting in an effort to control his compulsion for the instantaneous. Can he count to ten so slowly that he literally watches his paint dry? Can modern man recapture the virtue of patience?</p>

<p><strong>Your brain - unplugged</strong><br>
In today's high-stress world of over-stimulating torrents of information, it has become increasingly difficult to turn one's brain off at night to sleep. Thoughts of today's events and tomorrow's possibilities bombard the brain in constant assault. Are you able to allow your mind to unplug? To revert to gelatinous peacefulness for its necessary nocturnal rejuvenation?</p>

<p>Buckminster Fullest is a collaborative effort between a couple that found each other in the mountains of the American west.  Having worked together on projects such as travelogues, music boxes, and plush children's toys, the duo is presenting a new series of story-telling compositions that will shed light on some of their more far-fetched stories from the travelogue era.  Photography, artifacts, and audio accompaniment will lay bare some hotly contentious truths.</p>

<p>This once proud gallery which represented some of Seattle's finest artists has fallen on hard times. Like so many galleries, the ever increasing cost of overhead and a lack appreciation for art has forced Gallery 4x10 to move in new directions. As a result our patrons have become our artists... but then again, maybe they always have been.</p>

<p>Ms Jenkins (1820?- 1905) was born in Southern Wales into a family of itinerant lace peddlers. As a child she developed an unbecoming interest in science and the natural world and shunned worldly goals to pursue her passion. Living a life of almost total exclusion, she unexpectedly came to find public recognition and wide-spread fame at the age of 72, as the discoverer of the first known specimen of the Lesser Spotted Widget Frog.</p>

<p>Founded in 2001, the Recreation Institute has established a new vision for synthetic togetherness. By formulating banal forms and obscure gestures this collaborative has systematically failed to reach achievement while working steadily at substantive being. Paramount to their practice of inquiry is the equal honoring of industry and leisure, the Institute's members can typically be found in a phenomenological aura of elation while bearing soiled hands.</p>

<p>Breathing museum</br>
Ödön Lechner(1845–1914), the most important proponent of Hungarian art nouveau, designed the three-storey building at Üllöi út, which opened its doors in 1896. In contrast to his work on the later Post Savings Bank building, Lechner still had recourse to past – especially oriental – architectural forms for the Arts and Crafts Museum, and melded them with national elements from Hungarian folk art into a new style. Granite tiles and roof tiles in colourful patterns from the Zsolnay factory in Pécs enliven the façade. To the right of the main entrance stands a statue of the architect, created by Béla Farkas in 1936. The central inner courtyard, which is covered by a glass roof, and the ticket hall in front of it almost appear like a fairy tale with their mixture of Indian and Moorish designs. The construction with its unclad steel supports, similar to the West Railway Station, was highly modern at the time. The exhibition on the ground flooraround the courtyard covers Hungarian domestic culture from the Biedermeier era up to the start of the 20th century (approx. 1850–1900). Furniture, craftwork, carpets and other interior design items are shown in individual rooms that each represent a specific historical style or fashion. On the first floor, in similar manner to the rooms on the ground floor, it is possible to get a realistic idea of domestic life from the classical to Biedermeier era (approx. 1800–1850). The dome hall and the east wing accommodate five further departments on the development of Hungarian arts and crafts.</p>

<p>This device is used to measure the weight of the human soul using the exact body weight of dirt as the counter balance of for the human. According to Pre-Enlightenment beliefs if one could attain perfect equilibrium with the dirt, the human is then required to eat the dirt to complete the cycle and become completely attuned to the earth. The status of the person changes to a sort of agricultural prophet advising others on planting times, harvest, and particular rituals.</p>

<p>I will leave you with a paragraph about the <strong>value of artists in modern society</strong>.</p>

</p>"The definiteness and directedness of the conscious mind are extremely important acquisitions which humanity has bought at a very heavy sacrifice, and which in turn have rendered humanity the highest service. Without them science, technology, and civilization would be impossible, for they all presuppose the reliable continuity and directedness of the conscious process. For the statesman, doctor, and engineer  as well as for the simplest labourer, these qualities are absolutely indispensable. We may say in general that social worthlessness increases to the degree that these qualities  are impaired by the unconscious. Great artists and others distinguished by creative gifts are, of course, exceptions to the rule. The very advantage that such individuals enjoy consists precisely in the permeability of the partition separating the conscious and the unconscious. But, for those professions and social activities which require just this continuity and reliability, these exceptional human beings are as a rule of little value."<br>

<p>(all artists are showing under <strong>pencil names</strong> (=pseudonyms). True identities will be revealed during the evening.)</p>

<p>NEPO 4 is about <strong>learning</strong>. Inspired by the plight of guinea pigs, our brave artists stepped into the role of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism">model organism</a> and subjected themselves to all kinds of experiments (voluntarily or not). The role of our show is to make their failures and successes public, "with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms". These new discoveries will be presented in the style of a Natural History Museum, where exhibits will contain live humans (performances), objects and missing objects (some exhibits may be temporarily shut down due to lack of funding).<br>
<strong>Warning:</strong> The museum serves as a metaphor for our art world, and world in general - it might reflect it's current state!</p>

<p>And last, but not least, I am very excited to announce that poet <strong>Susan Parr</strong> will read poems from her book PACIFIC SHOOTER<br>
 ---- and ---- <br>
our<strong> musical guest</strong> will be none other then awesome Ms. <strong>Shenandoah Davis!</strong></p>
