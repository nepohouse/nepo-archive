Here is a story behind it: The three islands known variously as the Senkaku, Diaoyu, Tiaoyutai or Pinnacle Islands become figures at the center of a longstanding conflict over control among Japan, China, Taiwan, and the United States (each of which has had control of the sites at some point since the 14th century). The island figures are cloaked in dazzle-camouflage of national flag designs that echo the confusing, contentious and often bizarre dispute. </div><br>

<br> <div class="credit">Here is window #3 with yarn, knitting needles, ink, palette knife, pen gridded paper, spoon and butter. The hands busied themselves with a set of tasks creating "something" out of the raw materials and then reversing their steps and undoing their work. Watching a pair of hands meticulously involved with a task was a beautiful sight - also reminding us that creation is often a very messy process!</div><br>

<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_051.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit"> There was another aspect of this multifaceted show: as the performers remained anonymous, this piece brought to mind numerous "armies" of invisible workers around the world continuously, repetitively making things for our daily use. From their point of view the difference between making and unmaking is probably minuscule.</div><br>

<br> <div class="credit">JD Banke's <i>"the meaning of life is mysterious and infinite, let's talk about it"</i> was a visual metaphor for having an attitude that is positive in nature, but searching for good things in less than ideal situations. </div><br>

<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_104.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit">If perhaps you hopped into one of their cars in hopes of not having to walk the rest of the route, you were in for a disappointment - these guys were going nowhere. The real distance here was covered by driver/passenger scenarios ranging from archetypal long-winded boring storytellers and awkward question-askers to more unfamiliar weirdness. The phrase "you can let me out -  right here is fine" was a good one to remember, in case they went to far and/or you needed to end a bad trip.</div><br>


<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_105.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit">Hanita Schwartz's  performance <i>Almost Sugar</i> was based on her father's WWII story.</div><br>

<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_107.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit">On the other side of street from the "sand thieves" a "soldier character" sat on a chair - activating the space between them by a perpetual expectation of the act of trespassing.</div><br>

<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_109.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit">A neighborhood lot overgrown and houseless is characterized by what is absent. A couple listening to Ruth Marie Tomlinson's <i>Negative Space</i> - perhaps hearing the sound of wind, which in fact is not a sound inherent in the wind, but a result of what it encounters. In the same way negative space is defined by what it is not.  An uprooted tree is no longer a tree, but is described by what it was. Negative space is something of its own . . . but what is it?</div><br>

<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_111.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit">By now we hope you see the <i>Con ne ct ions</i> (by Carolyn Law).</div><br>

<img src="NEPO5k2013/NEPO5k2013_115.jpg" width="600">
<br> <div class="credit">Speaking of gorgeus, tacked along the way in unexpected places were large format prints by Serrah Russell called <i>Whispering Signs</i>.  Serrah used her sensibilities from working in collage, and collaged the prints directly into the existing environment, bringing the photographic image outside of a two-dimensional flat surface and combining it with, or even returning it to, the living and breathing reality from which it originated. She thinks of these works more as temporary sculptures rather than static images (later we've learned that some of the works were in fact so temporary that they disappeared just as the walk was getting started - luckily for us, a few remained). 	</div><br>

<br> <div class="credit">Taking turns throughout the afternoon, performers Alice Gosti and Ryan Law,  wrapped themselves in toilet paper, until completely covered and mummified to the point that no human features could be seen. Cocooned and disconnected from the outside world, this new, vulnerable creature couldn't see or hear, and was barely breathing. Eventually, the artist inside burst out of her shell, tearing the protective cocoon into shreds. Throughout the whole process of wrapping and unraveling people were invited to sit down on a little yellow chair next to the performer..</div><br>
