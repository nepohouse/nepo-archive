<h2>I'm Sorry. Thank You. I Love You.<br>

<h3></i>Rumi Koshino: Between the Figural and the Factual</i><br>
an essay by D.W. Burnam</h3>

<p><i>"Thus representation, from mimesis to fiction,
which we have been forced to hate for too long,
escapes from our control, from our condition of life,
instead of having made us its protagonists in alliance
with our environment."<br>
- Gloria Moure</i></p>

<p>Curiosity threatens equilibrium, whether it's sated or willfully
unredeemed. Curiosity calls us to approach one another, our
humanity contingent on faint signals in a fog of expectations;
to dispatch what we believe to be the history of our species.
As individuals we possess but one story that seeks its denouement
in the thicket of others' complexities. This tangle of
competing universals - to which the edifices of Historical
jurisprudence amply contribute and by no means clarify -
presents innumerable demarcations that find their reconciliation
not through mutual effacement but in articulating the cold
fact of where one thing stops and another begins. Relationship
continues past this, demanding that these lines hold even when
they're breached.</p>
<p>Peering down at Rumi Koshino's Love Letter (2010),
I keep getting distracted by my feet. A swath of 36 inch wide,
90-pound bond sheared directly from the roll drapes, just
above waist-high, across a staggered pair of skinny sawhorses.
The paper's languorous "M" simulates two vast ocean swells
as thousands (thousands!) of measured sumi hyphens swarm
across its surface in rippling phalanxes. Curious as I am to
really get down in there - to sight along one grade with an eye
closed - I just cannot keep from monitoring my brazen
flirtation with a huge gallery foul: I already hear the resounding
pule of my sneaker as it scoots the weightless leg of one of
these supports; I cringe at the scenario: my startledoverreaction-
two-step concludes with a windmill descent
directly - violently - into the center of the sculpture. And
there to break my fall is an almost unnoticeable bridge: a
pop-out micro-architected in the cleft between the humps with
serifed x-acto incisions. The bridge is of course not a structural
feature but details like the ribs of the trestles, rendered
with childlike diligence, foreground it as a hard edge, perhaps
an analogue to the sliver of floor beneath my feet about to
betray my faith in its perpendicularity as I half-cantilever
myself over the whole business for a better look. Although,
perhaps the whole thing's just a picture.</p>
<p>Koshino's work invites and then frustrates my
interactive impulse. Full contact interruption, accidental or
not, seems practically the only figurative immersion into the
world it captures. Love Letter delivers me only partial
glimpses into a lyric retelling, a limited contract it enforces
with the threat of its damage or collapse. In other of Koshino's
works, by a similar tactic, the recursive deployment of nets,
taut lines and cages points out a need or desire to restrict
access even to clearly accessible parts of the room. These
overt and covert focal directives ultimately play off of a
collective sense of art-viewing propriety and assert control
over the act of reading it.</p>
<p>The quasi-eponymous no-brainer, Nothing Is
Concrete (2010) features an approx. six-foot cube constructed
by stacking what, in a glance, appear to be cinder blocks but
turn out to be paper replicas of cinder blocks. Each little box
is deceptively faithful to the real deal in its faux finish, down
to the cameos of its characteristic dual orifices, only, of course,
renderings of false darkness. The edifice, with a knowing
wink, goes back on at least two agreements: solidity and
interiority, and so it starts to max out the tensile strength of the
cognitive 2D/3D barrier. The flat medium's twofold mimetic
device of bodily separation from an event and suspension in
perspective, here, carries over into habitable space. Its cover
blown, perhaps a little defensive, the bunker now just seems to
shit-talk me into proximity with it, testing ego restraint and
local air currents. I'm reminded, however, as I close the
distance between us, of a repressed love for plain-old artifice.
When I find myself in ambiguous spatial arrangements
I incline to the embrace of an external force - some
means to convey me through a medium for which I have no
tools. Things like film and television and bestsellers prescribe
a position for me and engineer my response; hardware
(camera, frame, page) and narrative syntax (simulated movement
in time and space) harness their participant into a virtual
field of action. Koshino provides the field for suspension but
denies the hardware, or rather. refuses to set it into motion, an
intentional oversight that prompts agency and, sometimes,
indignation.</p>
<p>Koshino's sculptures tend to antagonize themselves in
a similar way, pitting their elements against one another.
These oppositions, paired with an ornamental drift into
representation, situate the work inside vague narratives that
occasionally summon the movement and iconography of
picaresque, or the didactic adventure. There's no better
example of this treatment of progression than in works such
as, One Has to End to Begin, One Has to Begin to End (2009),
an extensive bridge system unfurling at the perimeters of the
gallery space. Koshino's bridges - other works feature them -
prescribe a line that, whether folded and painted paper, painted
ceramic or expressionist slashes of ink on the wall, read as
idiosyncratically treacherous. They splay open, their moorings
ambiguate or vanish altogether and, always, the damn things
just don't begin or end any way but abruptly. They're traps;
they undermine themselves; they're connections torn by some
allegiance to one half of their purpose. But most importantly,
they're bridges: like giant waves, and like cages, too, they're
literary marks that serve intensely symbolic agendas. Once
again I'm torn between the figural and the factual; I approach
the well-worn trope in Koshino's work the same way I
approach her signified-solid: with a wary eye on its true nature
to fall apart.</p>
<p>Despite all this antagonism, inside and out, the
thwarting of expectations, the strictures and unspoken provisos
and, finally, the repeated invitations to disaster, ultimately, as a
viewer, I don't perceive any of it as sabotage - cynical, critical
or otherwise. It seems more appropriate to characterize the
effort, riffing on one of Gloria Moure's reads on Jannis
Kounellis, as an anecdotal sort of "anthropometry," or the
study of measurements of the human body. Planting themselves
within range of physical discretion, retrofitting a space
built for "viewers" that has become generally averse to this
very act, Koshino's story-forms mediate an extradiscursive
experience of the unconscious tendency to plot line. As I
grapple with my own body's spatial invasiveness, I'm
reminded by this work that connections and insights aren't
preformed - the artist's product rarely heaves into view at the
checkout line as the log of linoleum and clattering sheaf of 1x2
hits the conveyor. A relationship is wrested from the teeth of
total inarticulateness and fear of extinction; a bond spans a
chasm from two ends only to shatter again and again under the
abiding, wordless weight of a subjective universality.
Koshino's work asks me to test how, and how far I'm willing to
breach my historically- and personally-demarcated zones. The
silence that follows me in can only make a space for me to
pose my own questions to forms that may never answer back.</p>
